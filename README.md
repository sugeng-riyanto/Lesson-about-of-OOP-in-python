## Session 1: Understanding OOP Concepts

### Key Concepts:
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - A paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods.

2. **Core Principles of OOP:**
   - **Encapsulation:** Wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) inside a single unit (class).
   - **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary functionality.
   - **Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones, enabling code reuse.
   - **Polymorphism:** Using the same interface for different data types.

3. **Components of OOP in Python:**
   - **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects.
   - **Object:** An instance of a class.
   - **Attributes:** Variables that belong to an object.
   - **Methods:** Functions defined within a class.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **What is a Class and Object?**
   ```python
   # Example of a Class and Object
   class Student:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def greet(self):
           return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}."

   # Creating an object
   student1 = Student("Alice", 16)
   print(student1.greet())
   ```

2. **Encapsulation Example:**
   ```python
   class BankAccount:
       def __init__(self, owner, balance):
           self.owner = owner
           self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

       def deposit(self, amount):
           self.__balance += amount

       def get_balance(self):
           return self.__balance

   account = BankAccount("Bob", 1000)
   account.deposit(500)
   print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
   ```

3. **Inheritance Example:**
   ```python
   class Animal:
       def speak(self):
           return "I make a sound"

   class Dog(Animal):
       def speak(self):
           return "Woof!"

   dog = Dog()
   print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!
   ```

4. **Polymorphism Example:**
   ```python
   class Bird:
       def fly(self):
           return "Flying high"

   class Penguin(Bird):
       def fly(self):
           return "I can't fly, but I can swim!"

   birds = [Bird(), Penguin()]
   for bird in birds:
       print(bird.fly())
   ```

## Session 2: Misconceptions in OOP

### Common Misconceptions and Explanations:

1. **Misconception: OOP is only for large projects.**
   - **Reality:** OOP is helpful for both small and large projects. It provides clarity and structure even in small programs.

2. **Misconception: All attributes should be private.**
   - **Reality:** While encapsulation is important, making all attributes private can make a program unnecessarily complex. Use private attributes only when needed.

3. **Misconception: Inheritance is always the best way to reuse code.**
   - **Reality:** Composition (using objects of other classes) can sometimes be a better alternative to inheritance.

4. **Misconception: You must always use OOP.**
   - **Reality:** Procedural programming is still appropriate for certain scenarios. Choose the paradigm based on the problem.

### Activity: Debug and Correct Misconceptions
Provide the following code snippets to students and ask them to identify and correct mistakes.

1. **Encapsulation Error:**
   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, speed):
           self.__speed = speed

   my_car = Car(120)
   print(my_car.speed)  # AttributeError
   ```
   **Correct Answer:**
   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, speed):
           self.__speed = speed

       def get_speed(self):
           return self.__speed

   my_car = Car(120)
   print(my_car.get_speed())
   ```

2. **Inheritance Misuse:**
   ```python
   class Bird:
       pass

   class Penguin(Bird):
       def swim(self):
           return "Swimming!"

   penguin = Penguin()
   print(penguin.fly())  # AttributeError
   ```
   **Correct Answer:**
   ```python
   class Bird:
       def fly(self):
           return "Flying!"

   class Penguin(Bird):
       def fly(self):
           return "I can't fly, but I can swim!"

   penguin = Penguin()
   print(penguin.fly())  # Output: I can't fly, but I can swim!
   ```

## Project: Create a Simple OOP-Based Program

### Task: Create a Library Management System
1. **Requirements:**
   - Create a `Book` class with attributes like title, author, and availability.
   - Create a `Library` class to manage books.
   - Include methods to add, remove, and display books.

2. **Expected Output:**
   ```python
   class Book:
       def __init__(self, title, author):
           self.title = title
           self.author = author
           self.is_available = True

   class Library:
       def __init__(self):
           self.books = []

       def add_book(self, book):
           self.books.append(book)

       def display_books(self):
           for book in self.books:
               status = "Available" if book.is_available else "Not Available"
               print(f"{book.title} by {book.author} - {status}")

   library = Library()
   book1 = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
   book2 = Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee")
   library.add_book(book1)
   library.add_book(book2)
   library.display_books()
   ```

## Reflection and Summary:
- Discuss the importance of OOP in organizing and maintaining code.
- Review the misconceptions and how to avoid them.
- Share insights from the project.

---

## Assessment:
1. **Quiz:**
   - Multiple-choice questions on OOP concepts and misconceptions.
2. **Coding Task:**
   - Extend the Library Management System by adding a feature to issue and return books.

This lesson plan ensures students understand OOP fundamentals while addressing and correcting misconceptions effectively.
